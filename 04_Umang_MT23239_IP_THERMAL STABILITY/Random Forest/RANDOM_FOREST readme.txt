					Predicting Protein Melting Temperature Using Machine Learning
Overview
This README file provides a detailed explanation of the process undertaken to predict the melting temperature of protein sequences using machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to develop a predictive model using RandomForestRegressor and GradientBoostingRegressor, leveraging features extracted from protein sequences through the Biopython library. The workflow includes loading the dataset, feature extraction, data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and predictions on new data.

Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

Python 3.x
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
You can install these libraries using pip.

Steps and Methodology
1. Load Dataset
The first step involves loading the dataset containing protein sequences and their corresponding melting temperatures. The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. Feature Extraction Using Biopython
Biopython is utilized to extract various features from the protein sequences. These features include molecular weight, aromaticity, instability index, isoelectric point, gravy, flexibility, charge at pH 7, and amino acid composition. The extracted features are stored in a DataFrame for further processing.

3. Data Preprocessing
Ensure Matching Lengths
Before proceeding, the length of the sequences is checked to ensure it matches the length of the melting temperature values. Any mismatched entries are removed to maintain consistency.

Remove Outliers
An optional step involves removing outliers from the combined dataset to improve model performance. This is achieved by calculating the z-scores and filtering out data points with z-scores greater than a specified threshold.

Data Splitting
The dataset is split into training and testing sets using an 80-20 split. This ensures that the model is trained on a majority of the data while reserving a portion for evaluation.

Standardization
Features are standardized to have zero mean and unit variance. Standardization helps improve the performance of many machine learning algorithms by bringing all features to the same scale.

4. Model Training and Evaluation
Hyperparameter Tuning
Two models are considered: RandomForestRegressor and GradientBoostingRegressor. Hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV to find the best parameters for each model. The tuning process involves testing different combinations of hyperparameters and selecting the one that yields the best performance based on cross-validation scores.

Model Training
The best models, identified through hyperparameter tuning, are trained on the training data. The training process involves fitting the models to the standardized feature set and the corresponding melting temperatures.

Model Evaluation
The trained models are evaluated on both the training and testing sets. Various metrics are calculated, including Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared (R²) scores, to assess the model's performance. Additionally, cross-validation is performed to obtain more reliable performance estimates.

5. Model Deployment
The trained RandomForest model, identified as the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics, is saved using joblib for future use. The saved model can be loaded and used to make predictions on new data.

6. Prediction on New Data
Feature Extraction from PDB Files
Features are extracted from new PDB files using a custom feature extraction function. This function processes the PDB file to extract relevant features required for prediction.

Prediction
The extracted features are used as input to the saved RandomForest model to predict the melting temperature of the protein. The predicted value is displayed as the output.

Results and Interpretation
The results include the best hyperparameters identified for the RandomForest and GradientBoosting models, along with their respective performance metrics. The models are evaluated based on RMSE and R² scores for both training and testing sets. Additionally, cross-validation scores provide a more reliable estimate of the model's performance.


Conclusion
This project demonstrates a comprehensive workflow for predicting protein melting temperatures using machine learning. By leveraging feature extraction from protein sequences and employing robust machine-learning techniques, accurate predictions can be made. The saved model can be used for future predictions, enabling researchers to estimate protein stability effectively.
