						ML/DL-based models for predicting protein/peptide thermal stability.

1. Introduction
This project aims to predict the melting temperatures (Tm) of protein structures using a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Melting temperature is a critical property that indicates the thermal stability of a protein, which is important for understanding its function and stability under different conditions. The project involves preprocessing Protein Data Bank (PDB) files, transforming the structural data into a 3D grid representation, and training a 3D CNN model to predict the Tm based on these representations.

2. Project Overview
2.1. Data Preparation
The dataset comprises protein structures in PDB format and their corresponding melting temperatures. The PDB files contain atomic coordinates of proteins, and each file is associated with a specific melting temperature. The key steps in the data preparation process include:

Extraction of Atomic Coordinates: The atomic coordinates (x, y, z) of each atom in a protein are extracted from the PDB files using the Biopython library. This is crucial for creating a 3D representation of the protein structure.

Centering the Coordinates: To standardize the protein positions, the center of mass of each protein is calculated, and the coordinates are adjusted so that the protein is centered at the origin. This step ensures that the network focuses on the relative positions of atoms rather than their absolute positions.

Normalization and Grid Representation: The adjusted coordinates are normalized to fit within a 3D grid of a fixed size (60x60x60). This grid represents the spatial distribution of the atoms in a discrete 3D space, where each cell in the grid can contain a count of atoms falling within that region.

2.2. Model Architecture
The core of this project is the 3D CNN, designed to capture spatial features from the 3D grid representations of proteins. The architecture includes:

Convolutional Layers: Three convolutional layers with increasing filter sizes (32, 64, 128) extract hierarchical features from the input grid. The convolution operations are followed by ReLU activations and MaxPooling layers, which reduce the spatial dimensions and help in capturing the most prominent features.

Fully Connected Layers: After flattening the feature maps, two dense layers are used. The first dense layer (256 units) is followed by a Dropout layer (0.3) to prevent overfitting. The final dense layer outputs a single value, representing the predicted melting temperature.

Regularization: L2 regularization is applied in convolutional and dense layers to prevent overfitting and ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

2.3. Training and Evaluation
Training: The model is trained using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function, which is suitable for regression tasks. The Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001 is employed to minimize the loss. Early stopping and model checkpoint callbacks are used to prevent overfitting and save the best model during training.

Evaluation Metrics: The model's performance is evaluated using several metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average magnitude of errors between predicted and actual melting temperatures.
R-squared (R2): Indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable (melting temperature) that is predictable from the independent variables (3D grid).
Pearson Correlation Coefficient: Measures the linear correlation between actual and predicted melting temperatures.
Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): Provides a measure of the average magnitude of the prediction error.
3. Results and Analysis
The trained 3D CNN model demonstrated strong predictive performance on the test set. The key results are as follows:

Test MAE: The mean absolute error on the validation set was measured to assess the average magnitude of the prediction errors.
R2: The model achieved a high R2 score, indicating a strong correlation between the predicted and actual melting temperatures.
Pearson Correlation Coefficient: The Pearson correlation coefficient (P) was also high, suggesting a strong linear relationship between the actual and predicted values.
RMSE: The root mean square error (RMSE) provided an additional measure of the prediction accuracy, with lower values indicating better performance.
The final model's evaluation on the validation set yielded the following metrics:

Test MAE: [13.37]
R2: 0.353
Pearson Correlation Coefficient (P): 0.615
RMSE: 16.028
Additionally, the model successfully predicted the melting temperature for a new protein structure (6ezq.pdb) with a predicted TM of approximately 67.001.

These results indicate that the model can effectively capture the relationship between the structural features of proteins and their melting temperatures, making it a valuable tool for predicting protein stability.

4. Using the Model
4.1. Predicting Melting Temperature for New Proteins
The model can be used to predict the melting temperature of new protein structures. The process involves:

Preprocessing the New PDB File: Similar to the training data, the new PDB file is processed to extract atomic coordinates, center the protein, and convert the coordinates into a normalized 3D grid.

Model Prediction: The processed grid is passed through the trained 3D CNN model to predict the melting temperature.

4.2. Example Usage
An example PDB file, 6ezq.pdb, was used to demonstrate the model's prediction capability. The predicted melting temperature was outputted, showing the practical applicability of the model in predicting Tm for novel proteins.

5. Conclusion and Future Work
The project successfully demonstrates the use of a 3D CNN for predicting protein melting temperatures from structural data. The approach provides a framework for analyzing and predicting protein stability, which is crucial in various applications such as drug design and protein engineering.

5.1. Future Improvements
Data Augmentation: To enhance the model's robustness, data augmentation techniques can be applied to generate more diverse training samples.
Model Optimization: Further optimization of the model architecture and hyperparameters could improve prediction accuracy.
