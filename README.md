                                                        Protein/Peptide Thermal Stability Prediction
Project Overview
This project aims to predict the melting temperature (Tm) of proteins, which is a key indicator of their thermal stability, using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. Accurate prediction of protein Tm is critical in fields such as drug design, protein engineering, and understanding disease mechanisms.

Objectives
->Develop 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict protein Tm from 3D structural data.
->Implement Random Forest to predict Tm using sequence-derived features and physicochemical properties of proteins.
Data Collection and Preprocessing
The primary data source is the Protein Data Bank (PDB), which provides detailed 3D structural data of proteins. Key preprocessing steps include:

Reading PDB files.
Centering protein coordinates.
Creating a 3D grid representation.
Extracting atomic and physicochemical features.
Model Development
3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Input Layer: 3D grid representation of proteins.
Convolutional Layers: Conv3D layers with ReLU activation to capture spatial features.
Pooling Layers: MaxPooling3D for dimensionality reduction.
Dense Layers: Fully connected layers for integrating learned features.
Output Layer: Predicting continuous Tm values.
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
Graph Convolutional Layers: Aggregating features from neighboring atoms.
Message Passing: For capturing local and global graph patterns.
Random Forest
An ensemble method used to predict Tm based on sequence-derived features.
Results and Evaluation
The 3D CNN achieved strong predictive performance with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 13.37 and RÂ² of 0.35 on the test set. The model captured complex spatial features influencing protein stability. Random Forest and other traditional ML models were also explored, with Random Forest showing robust performance.

Challenges
Computational Complexity: 3D CNNs require substantial computational resources.
Data Quality: Variability in the quality of PDB structures affected consistency.
Model Generalization: Overfitting and generalization to unseen data are ongoing challenges.
Future Work
Improve feature extraction by integrating secondary structure information from tools like GMX do_dssp.
Explore more advanced GNN architectures and hybrid models combining CNN approaches.
Optimize model generalization by expanding the dataset and applying regularization techniques.
